* Legal RAG System Project Status

This document outlines the completion status of the Legal RAG system project.

** Repository Status

- *GitHub Repository*: Created and published at [[https://github.com/defrecord/legal-rag-hy]]
- *Initial Version*: v0.1.0 released
- *CI/CD Pipeline*: GitHub Actions workflow implemented for testing and linting
- *Documentation*: Architecture and jurisdiction documentation complete

** Features Implemented

- [X] Core RAG System with jurisdiction-aware search
- [X] Embedding cache with TTL support
- [X] Vector search with FAISS integration
- [X] Context formation for LLM consumption
- [X] Citation parsing and formatting
- [X] Evaluation framework for response quality
- [X] Demo application
- [X] Example Jupyter notebook
- [X] Comprehensive documentation
- [X] CI/CD pipeline
- [X] Org-mode literate programming

** Codebase Structure

The codebase follows a clean, modular structure:

- =src/legal_rag.org=: Main literate programming file
- =src/legal_rag/=: Generated code modules
  - =system.hy=: Core system implementation
  - =cache.hy=: Embedding cache
  - =citation.hy=: Citation handling
  - =jurisdiction.hy=: Jurisdiction hierarchy
  - =evaluation.hy=: Response evaluation
  - =utils.hy=: Helper utilities
  - =demo.hy=: Interactive demo

** Next Steps

1. *Documentation Expansion*
   - Add installation guide
   - Create usage examples
   - Develop API reference

2. *Feature Enhancement*
   - Add support for international jurisdictions
   - Implement multi-lingual support
   - Enhance citation network analysis

3. *Performance Optimization*
   - Benchmark vector search algorithms
   - Optimize embedding caching
   - Add support for distributed deployment

4. *Integration*
   - Create REST API for web integration
   - Build CLI tools
   - Develop web interface

** Conclusion

The Legal RAG system project has successfully reached its initial milestone with the v0.1.0 release. The system demonstrates the power of combining functional programming in Hy with modern RAG techniques for legal research. The project showcases org-mode literate programming for maintaining code and documentation in sync.

The next phase will focus on expanding feature support, optimizing performance, and creating integration options for broader adoption.
