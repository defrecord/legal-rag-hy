* Final Status Report: 2025-03-23

** Project Summary

The Legal RAG System project has been successfully completed, implementing a jurisdiction-aware Retrieval-Augmented Generation system for legal research using Hy and org-mode literate programming.

** Key Achievements

1. *Core Functionality*
   - Implemented jurisdiction-aware vector search
   - Created TTL-based embedding cache
   - Developed citation parsing and formatting
   - Built comprehensive evaluation framework
   - Implemented error handling with retries

2. *Repository Structure*
   - Established clean, modular organization
   - Used org-mode literate programming throughout
   - Implemented round-trip editing (tangle/detangle)
   - Created comprehensive documentation

3. *Development Infrastructure*
   - Set up GitHub repository and CI/CD
   - Created issue templates
   - Added BibTeX citation support
   - Implemented git trailer attribution

4. *Documentation*
   - User-focused README
   - Detailed CONTRIBUTING guide
   - Comprehensive DEVELOPERS guide
   - Specialized guides (org-mode, architecture, jurisdiction)

** Repository Status

- GitHub: [[https://github.com/defrecord/legal-rag-hy]]
- Current Version: v0.1.0
- Last Commit: docs: move technical details to DEVELOPERS and CONTRIBUTING guides
- Issues Created: 5 enhancement issues for future work

** Impact and Value

This project demonstrates:

1. *Domain-Specific Adaptation*: Shows how RAG systems can be specialized for legal research through jurisdiction-aware search and citation handling

2. *Functional Programming*: Demonstrates Hy's capabilities for functional programming patterns in a production system

3. *Literate Programming*: Showcases org-mode as a powerful approach to maintaining code and documentation in sync

4. *Best Practices*: Implements modern development workflows with comprehensive CI/CD, documentation, and attribution

** Next Steps

The following areas have been identified for future work:

1. International jurisdiction support
2. Multi-lingual capabilities
3. Enhanced citation network analysis
4. REST API and web interface
5. Performance benchmarking for vector databases

These are tracked in GitHub issues #1-5.
