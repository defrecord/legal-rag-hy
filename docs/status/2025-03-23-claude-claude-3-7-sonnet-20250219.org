* Status Report: 2025-03-23
** Overview

Today, we successfully implemented a jurisdiction-aware Legal RAG system using Hy and org-mode literate programming. The system provides an efficient and accurate approach to legal research with several key features.

** Implementation Details

*** Core System

The core RAG system was implemented with the following components:

- Jurisdiction-aware vector search using FAISS
- Embedding cache with TTL for improved performance
- Citation parsing and formatting
- Evaluation framework for assessing response quality
- Comprehensive error handling with retries and timeouts

*** Repository Structure

We established a clean, modular structure following literate programming principles:

- ~src/legal_rag.org~ - Main literate programming file that tangles to:
  - ~system.hy~ - Core system implementation
  - ~cache.hy~ - Embedding cache with TTL
  - ~citation.hy~ - Citation handling
  - ~jurisdiction.hy~ - Jurisdiction hierarchy
  - ~evaluation.hy~ - Response evaluation
  - ~utils.hy~ - Helper utilities
  - ~demo.hy~ - Interactive demo

*** Repository Setup

1. Created the GitHub repository: [[https://github.com/defrecord/legal-rag-hy]]
2. Implemented CI/CD with GitHub Actions
3. Created proper documentation in org-mode
4. Added example Jupyter notebooks
5. Released version 0.1.0

** Development Workflow

We established a development workflow that emphasizes:

1. Literate programming with org-mode
2. Conventional commits with git trailers
3. Comprehensive testing and documentation
4. CI/CD integration

** Next Steps

1. Expand documentation further
2. Implement international jurisdiction support
3. Add multi-lingual capabilities
4. Enhance citation network analysis
5. Create API integrations
