#+DESCRIPTION: Guidelines for using Claude Code with the Legal RAG system project

* CLAUDE.org

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

** Build/Test/Lint Commands

#+begin_src bash
# Install dependencies
make dev

# Tangle code from org files (required after org file changes)
make tangle

# Run all tests
make test

# Run a single test
python -m pytest tests/specific_test_file.py::TestClass::test_method -v

# Run tests with coverage
make coverage

# Check formatting
make lint

# Apply formatting
make format
#+end_src

** Code Style Guidelines

*** General
- *Org-mode Literate Programming*: All implementation should be in org-mode files, then tangled
- After editing org files, run ~make tangle~ to generate code files

*** Hy Style (Lisp dialect)
- Use lisp-case (~defn calculate-score~ not ~calculateScore~)
- 2-space indentation
- Use threading macros (~->>~) for cleaner data pipelines
- Prefer functional patterns over imperative ones

*** Python Integration
- Follow PEP 8 for Python interfaces
- Use snake_case for Python functions/variables
- Line length: 88 characters (Black default)
- Imports: grouped by stdlib, third-party, local with one blank line between
- Types: Use type hints where appropriate
- Error handling: Use specific exceptions with meaningful error messages

** Git Commit Guidelines

*** Conventional Commits
- Format: ~<type>(<scope>): <description>~
- Types: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, perf, test, build, ci

*** Git Trailers (REQUIRED)
- NEVER use GPG signing (use ~--no-gpg-sign~)
- Use helper script: ~./scripts/git-commit-with-trailers.sh~
- All commits MUST include trailers (Driving-Agent, LLM-Agent, LLM-Model, etc.)
- Do NOT include "Generated with Claude" in commit messages

** Important Notes

*** File Precedence and Immutability
- CLAUDE.org is the official source of truth for Claude Code guidelines
- CLAUDE.md exists only to direct to CLAUDE.org and must NEVER be modified
- Always follow org-mode conventions for documentation in this project
