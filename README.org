This repository contains a production-ready Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system specifically designed for legal research, implemented using Hy (a Lisp dialect embedded in Python).

** Overview

The Legal RAG System provides an efficient, accurate, and jurisdiction-aware approach to legal research by:

- Retrieving relevant legal documents from a vector database based on queries
- Enhancing document relevance with jurisdiction-aware scoring
- Generating accurate, well-cited answers using LLMs
- Providing an efficient embedding cache with TTL to reduce API costs
- Supporting multiple document types (cases, statutes, regulations)

** Features

- *Jurisdiction-Aware Retrieval*: Boosts relevance based on jurisdictional hierarchy
- *Citation Network Analysis*: Weights documents by citation relationships
- *Embedding Cache*: TTL-based caching with version tracking
- *Failure Handling*: Graceful degradation with fallbacks
- *Evaluation Framework*: Comprehensive metrics for RAG performance
- *Optimized Vector Search*: Efficient similarity search with FAISS

** Installation

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/defrecord/legal-rag-hy.git
cd legal-rag-hy

# Install dependencies
pip install -e .
#+END_SRC

** Usage

Basic usage example:

#+BEGIN_SRC hy
(import [legal-rag.system [LegalRAGSystem]])

;; Initialize the system
(setv rag-system (LegalRAGSystem 
                   :embedding-model "text-embedding-3-large"
                   :llm-model "gpt-4o"
                   :jurisdiction "CA-9"))

;; Query the system
(setv query "What constitutes fair use under copyright law?")
(setv response (rag-system.query query))

;; Display the response with citations
(print response.answer)
(print "\nCitations:")
(for [citation response.citations]
  (print citation))
#+END_SRC

** Architecture

The system is built with a modular architecture:

1. *Query Processing*: Pre-processes legal queries for optimal retrieval
2. *Vector Search*: Jurisdiction-aware document retrieval with FAISS
3. *Context Formation*: Structures retrieved documents for the LLM
4. *Answer Generation*: Produces accurate, well-cited responses
5. *Embedding Cache*: Optimizes performance and reduces API costs
6. *Evaluation Module*: Assesses system performance with multiple metrics
