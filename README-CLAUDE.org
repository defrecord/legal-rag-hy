* Claude Code Development Notes

This document tracks Claude Code's contributions to the Legal RAG system project.

** Project Overview

The Legal RAG System provides a jurisdiction-aware Retrieval-Augmented Generation system for legal research, implemented in Hy and using org-mode literate programming.

** Key Contributions

*** Day 1 (2025-03-23)

*Key Components Implemented*:

1. *Core RAG System with Jurisdiction Awareness*
   - Implemented vector search with jurisdiction-based boosting
   - Created embedding cache with TTL support
   - Developed citation parsing and formatting
   - Built comprehensive evaluation framework
   - Implemented error handling with retries and timeouts

2. *Repository Infrastructure*
   - Set up GitHub repository and CI/CD with GitHub Actions
   - Created org-mode documentation structure
   - Implemented Makefile with dynamic help
   - Added BibTeX citation generation
   - Converted all documentation to org-mode format

3. *Demonstration Components*
   - Created interactive demo application
   - Developed Jupyter notebook example with visualizations
   - Added example legal documents for testing

4. *Development Tools*
   - Added git-commit-with-trailers.sh script
   - Implemented proper attribution in all commits
   - Created comprehensive CLAUDE.org guidelines

** Documentation Strategy

Documentation for this project follows these principles:

1. *Org-mode for Everything*
   - All documentation uses org-mode format
   - Code and documentation maintained together through literate programming
   - Both developer and user documentation in same format

2. *Consistent Structure*
   - Clear hierarchy of concepts with proper headings
   - Code examples in source blocks with language specification
   - Diagrams and visualizations where appropriate

3. *Attribution and Citation*
   - Complete attribution for all contributions
   - BibTeX citation available via ~make citation~
   - Citation recommended for academic use

** Future Roadmap

The next development phases should focus on:

1. International jurisdiction support
2. Multi-lingual capabilities
3. Enhanced citation network analysis
4. REST API and CLI tools
5. Web interface for interactive use

** Conclusion

This project demonstrates the power of combining:

1. Functional programming (via Hy)
2. Literate programming (via org-mode)
3. LLM-assisted development (via Claude)
4. Legal domain knowledge (jurisdiction-aware RAG)

The jurisdiction-aware retrieval approach significantly improves legal research by ensuring results respect the hierarchical nature of legal precedent.
